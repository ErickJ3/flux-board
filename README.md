# Trello Like with Nestjs and Nextjs

## Running an application

Go to the `flux-backend` folder and just run it with 
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
this command will upload a postgresql database and start the api in a docker container

for the nextjs application just navigate to the `flux` folder and start the command

```bash 
npm install
```
and
```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```
